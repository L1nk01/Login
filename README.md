# Login

This project is a basic implementation of a login system, does not provide any security,
does not make proper use of htaccess nor has a proper router and since it's a project I
made when I only had only 6 months programming has lots of spaghetti code.

In order to set it up it just drop it in the htdocs/projects folder of any LAMP/WAMP
software and it should work.
